# bulldozer-price-prediction
This project predicts bulldozer resale prices using a Kaggle dataset. I performed data analysis, visualization, and model building with scikit-learn, optimizing models via hyperparameter tuning and GridSearchCV. It showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization.

## Data Source  
The dataset is downloaded from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data).  

## Data Storage  
Place the downloaded dataset inside the `Data` folder.  
> **Note:** The `Data` folder is excluded from version control (`.gitignore`), so it won't be included in the repository.  


Additionally, the important features used for making predictions are plotted at the end of the Jupyter notebook. These plots help to visualize which features play a significant role in the model's predictions..

## Requirement 
requirement to run the end-to-end-heart-disease.ipynb is 
    - python(3.8.19 or above)
    - sklearn
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - seaborn
